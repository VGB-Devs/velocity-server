# velocity-server
A webserver app written in pure c++, no third party modules.


To install clone the repo then run "make" in the directoy of the source code.
then to execute the program type "sudo ./web". This will on work on Linux/UNIX machines,
sorry windows :/ (not sorry lol)

To edit the html file edit the index.html file dont worry about re compiling the app will
read it as required.

**I recomend not using for production at this point in time**
